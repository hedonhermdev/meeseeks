**LLaMA-rs** is a Rust port of the
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) project. This allows running
inference for Facebook's [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)
model on a CPU with good performance using full precision, f16 or 4-bit
quantized versions of the model.

Just like its C++ counterpart, it is powered by the
[`ggml`](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) tensor library, achieving the same
performance as the original code.

## Getting started

Make sure you have a Rust 1.65.0 or above and C toolchain[^1] set up.

`llama-rs` is a Rust library, while `llama-cli` is a CLI application that wraps
`llama-rs` and offers basic inference capabilities.

The following instructions explain how to build `llama-cli`.

**NOTE**: For best results, make sure to build and run in release mode.
Debug builds are going to be very slow.

### Building using `cargo`

Run

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/rustformers/llama-rs llama-cli
```

to install `llama-cli` to your Cargo `bin` directory, which `rustup` is likely to
have added to your `PATH`.

It can then be run through `llama-cli`.

### Building from repository

Clone the repository, and then build it through

```shell
cargo build --release --bin llama-cli
```

The resulting binary will be at `target/release/llama-cli[.exe]`.

It can also be run directly through Cargo, using

```shell
cargo run --release --bin llama-cli -- <ARGS>
```

This is useful for development.

### Getting the weights

In order to run the inference code in `llama-rs`, a copy of the model's weights
are required. Currently, the only legal source to get the weights is [this
repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/README.md#llama).
Note that the choice of words also may or may not hint at the existence of other
kinds of sources.

After acquiring the weights, it is necessary to convert them into a format that
is compatible with ggml. To achieve this, follow the steps outlined below:

> **Warning**
>
> To run the Python scripts, a Python version of 3.9 or 3.10 is required. 3.11
> is unsupported at the time of writing.

```shell
# Convert the model to f16 ggml format
python3 scripts/convert-pth-to-ggml.py /path/to/your/models/7B/ 1

# Quantize the model
**Note** To quantize the model, for now using llama.cpp is necessary. This will be fixed once #84 is merged.
```

> **Note**
>
> The [llama.cpp repository](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) has
> additional information on how to obtain and run specific models. With some
> caveats:
>
> Currently, `llama-rs` supports both the old (unversioned) and the new
> (versioned) ggml formats, but not the mmap-ready version that was [recently
> merged](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/613).

_Support for other open source models is currently planned. For models where
weights can be legally distributed, this section will be updated with scripts to
make the install process as user-friendly as possible. Due to the model's legal
requirements, this is currently not possible with LLaMA itself and a more
lengthy setup is required._

### Running

For example, try the following prompt:

```shell
llama-cli infer -m <path>/ggml-model-q4_0.bin -p "Tell me how cool the Rust programming language is:"
```

Some additional things to try:

- Use `--help` to see a list of available options.
- If you have the [alpaca-lora](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) weights,
  try `repl` mode!

  ```shell
  llama-cli repl -m <path>/ggml-alpaca-7b-q4.bin -f examples/alpaca_prompt.txt
  ```

  ![Gif showcasing alpaca repl mode](./doc/resources/alpaca_repl_screencap.gif)

- Sessions can be loaded (`--load-session`) or saved (`--save-session`) to file. To automatically load
  and save the same session, use `--persist-session`. This can be used to cache prompts to reduce load
  time, too:

  (This GIF shows an older version of the flags, but the mechanics are still the same.)

[^1]:
    A modern-ish C toolchain is required to compile `ggml`. A C++ toolchain
    should not be necessary.

### Docker

```shell
# To build (This will take some time, go grab some coffee):
docker build -t llama-rs .

# To run with prompt:
docker run --rm --name llama-rs -it -v ${PWD}/data:/data -v ${PWD}/examples:/examples llama-rs infer -m data/gpt4all-lora-quantized-ggml.bin -p "Tell me how cool the Rust programming language is:"

# To run with prompt file and repl (will wait for user input):
docker run --rm --name llama-rs -it -v ${PWD}/data:/data -v ${PWD}/examples:/examples llama-rs repl -m data/gpt4all-lora-quantized-ggml.bin -f examples/alpaca_prompt.txt
```

## Q&A

### Why did you do this?

It was not my choice. Ferris appeared to me in my dreams and asked me
to rewrite this in the name of the Holy crab.

### Seriously now.

Come on! I don't want to get into a flame war. You know how it goes,
_something something_ memory _something something_ cargo is nice, don't make
me say it, everybody knows this already.

### I insist.

_Sheesh! Okaaay_. After seeing the huge potential for **llama.cpp**,
the first thing I did was to see how hard would it be to turn it into a
library to embed in my projects. I started digging into the code, and realized
the heavy lifting is done by `ggml` (a C library, easy to bind to Rust) and
the whole project was just around ~2k lines of C++ code (not so easy to bind).
After a couple of (failed) attempts to build an HTTP server into the tool, I
realized I'd be much more productive if I just ported the code to Rust, where
I'm more comfortable.

### Is this the real reason?

Haha. Of course _not_. I just like collecting imaginary internet
points, in the form of little stars, that people seem to give to me whenever I
embark on pointless quests for _rewriting X thing, but in Rust_.

### How is this different from `llama.cpp`?

This is a reimplementation of `llama.cpp` that does not share any code with it
outside of `ggml`. This was done for a variety of reasons:

- `llama.cpp` requires a C++ compiler, which can cause problems for
  cross-compilation to more esoteric platforms. An example of such a platform
  is WebAssembly, which can require a non-standard compiler SDK.
- Rust is easier to work with from a development and open-source perspective;
  it offers better tooling for writing "code in the large" with many other
  authors. Additionally, we can benefit from the larger Rust ecosystem with
  ease.
- We would like to make `ggml` an optional backend
  (see [this issue](https://github.com/rustformers/llama-rs/issues/31)).

In general, we hope to build a solution for model inferencing that is as easy
to use and deploy as any other Rust crate.
